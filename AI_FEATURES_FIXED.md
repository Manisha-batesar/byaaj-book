1. **Natural Language Loan Creation**:
   - "Add loan for Raj, 25000 rupees, 15% yearly"
   - "राज के लिए 25000 का लोन, 15% सालाना"
   - Automatically extracts borrower name, amount, rate, and method

2. **Smart Search**:
   - Searches by name, amount, phone, date, status
   - Voice commands work in both languages
   - AI helps interpret search queries

3. **Contextual Help**:
