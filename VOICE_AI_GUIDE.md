# Voice AI Integration Guide - ByajBook

## Overview
ByajBook now includes advanced Voice AI capabilities powered by Google's Gemini AI and Web Speech API. Users can interact with the app using voice commands in both English and Hindi.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Voice Input Button
**Location**: Available in app headers on:
- Dashboard page
- Loan details page 
- Calculator page

**Appearance**: 
- Green microphone icon when ready
- Red pulsating icon when listening
- Disabled state when voice/AI not available

### 2. Voice Recognition
- **Language Support**: Automatic detection of Hindi and English
- **Real-time Processing**: Converts speech to text using Web Speech API
- **Browser Support**: Chrome, Edge, Safari (latest versions)
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation when voice not supported

### 3. AI Response Generation
- **Context Awareness**: Knows about user's loans and current page context
- **Bilingual**: Responds in the language user spoke (Hindi/English)
- **Voice Output**: Text-to-speech response playback
- **Smart Suggestions**: Provides relevant follow-up questions

## User Experience Flow

### Step 1: Voice Input
1. User taps the microphone button
2. App starts listening (button turns red and pulses)
3. User speaks their question/command
4. App automatically stops when speech ends

### Step 2: AI Processing
1. Speech is converted to text
2. Language is auto-detected (Hindi/English)
3. Text is sent to Gemini AI with loan context
4. AI generates contextually relevant response

### Step 3: Response Delivery
1. Response dialog opens showing:
   - What the user said (transcript)
   - AI's response text
   - Voice playback controls
2. If voice synthesis is supported, AI response is spoken aloud
3. User can stop audio or ask follow-up questions

## Example Voice Interactions

### English Examples:
- "How much interest will I earn on 10,000 rupees at 12% for 6 months?"
- "What's the outstanding amount for my loan to John?"
- "Calculate compound interest for 5 years"
- "Show me all overdue loans"

### Hindi Examples:
- "दस हज़ार रुपए पर बारह प्रतिशत दर से छह महीने का ब्याज कितना होगा?"
- "जॉन को दिए गए ऋण की बकाया राशि कितनी है?"
- "पांच साल के लिए चक्रवृद्धि ब्याज की गणना करें"
- "सभी ओवरड्यू ऋण दिखाएं"

## Technical Implementation

### Components Created:
1. **VoiceInputButton** (`/src/components/voice-input-button.tsx`)
   - Standalone microphone button with tooltip
   - Handles voice recording and AI communication
   - Shows response in modal dialog
   - Context-aware (knows current loan when applicable)

### Voice Utilities:
- **VoiceManager**: Coordinates recognition and synthesis
- **Language Detection**: Automatically identifies Hindi vs English
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failures with user feedback

### Integration Points:
- **Dashboard**: General loan management queries
- **Loan Details**: Specific loan calculations and info
- **Calculator**: Interest calculation assistance

## Browser Compatibility

### Fully Supported:
- Chrome 80+ (Desktop & Mobile)
- Edge 80+ (Desktop & Mobile)
- Safari 14+ (macOS/iOS)

### Partially Supported:
- Firefox (speech recognition limited)
- Older browser versions (text-only fallback)

### Feature Detection:
- Automatic check for voice capabilities
- UI adapts based on available features
- Clear messaging when features unavailable

## Setup Requirements

### For Full Functionality:
1. **Gemini API Key**: Required for AI responses
   - Get from Google AI Studio (makersuite.google.com)
   - Add to `.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY`

2. **HTTPS/Localhost**: Required for microphone access
   - Works on localhost for development
   - Requires HTTPS in production

3. **Microphone Permission**: Browser will request permission
   - Users must allow microphone access
   - Permission persists for the domain

## Error Handling & Fallbacks

### Common Scenarios:
1. **No API Key**: Button shows setup required tooltip
2. **No Microphone**: Voice input disabled, text fallback available
3. **No Internet**: Local voice recognition still works
4. **Permission Denied**: Clear error message with retry option

### Graceful Degradation:
- Voice button hidden if completely unsupported
- Text-only AI still available via chat interface
- Manual calculations remain fully functional

## Security & Privacy

### Voice Data:
- **No Server Storage**: Voice data never leaves user's device
- **Real-time Processing**: Speech converted to text locally
- **No Recording**: Audio is not saved or transmitted

### AI Integration:
- **Contextual Only**: Only relevant loan data sent to AI
- **No Personal Storage**: No conversation history on servers
- **User Control**: Can disable AI features entirely

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations:
- **Lazy Loading**: Voice components load only when needed
- **Efficient API Calls**: Minimal data sent to Gemini
- **Local Processing**: Speech recognition happens on device
- **Smart Caching**: Common responses cached locally

### Best Practices:
- **Short Queries**: Work best with concise questions
- **Clear Speech**: Speak clearly for better recognition
- **Quiet Environment**: Reduces background noise interference

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:
1. **Voice Commands**: Direct actions via voice ("Add a loan for John")
2. **Voice Shortcuts**: Quick access to common tasks
3. **Offline AI**: Local AI model for basic questions
4. **Multi-language**: Support for more Indian languages

### User Feedback Integration:
- Voice recognition accuracy improvements
- AI response quality enhancements
- User interface optimizations based on usage patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Microphone not working**: Check browser permissions
2. **No AI response**: Verify API key setup
3. **Poor recognition**: Speak more clearly, reduce background noise
4. **Button not visible**: Check browser compatibility

### Debug Steps:
1. Open browser console for error messages
2. Check network tab for API call failures
3. Verify microphone permissions in browser settings
4. Test on different browsers/devices

## Getting Started

### Quick Test:
1. Navigate to dashboard: `http://localhost:3002/dashboard`
2. Look for green microphone icon in header
3. Click and speak: "What is the total amount I have lent?"
4. Wait for AI response and listen to audio output

### Full Setup:
1. Add Gemini API key to environment
2. Ensure HTTPS or localhost
3. Allow microphone permissions
4. Test voice recognition and AI responses

**Note**: This implementation represents Step 2 of the AI integration roadmap. The voice input button provides a seamless way for users to interact with their loan data using natural speech in their preferred language.
