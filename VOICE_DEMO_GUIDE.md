#### If "Nothing happens when clicking mic":
- Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
- Check Console tab for error messages
- Ensure you're on HTTPS or localhost (required for mic access)

#### If "Text doesn't appear":
- Speak clearly and loudly enough
- Wait a moment after speaking for final transcription
